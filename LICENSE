Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GPL
is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free softwareâ€”
to make sure the software is free for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech,
not as in free beer.

You may copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, without asking permission.

2. If you modify the Program and distribute it, you must include a prominent notice stating that you have changed the files.

3. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
